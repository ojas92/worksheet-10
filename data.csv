itsmost prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such ascoffee and soybeans and might maximize foreign exchangerevenue by selling hard on world markets economists said that sounds like a reasonable strategy but there is noway they can trade their way out of this situation aldoroldan vice president for international services at chaseeconometrics said roldan told reuters that brazil not only had to tackle theproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on gluttedworld markets but also had to work to make its position onforeign exchange markets more profitable domestic costs have increased due to inflation andexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchangerates roldan said the chase economist also said commodities markets weredepressed and generally did not appear very promising for acountry like brazil where pure commodities account for some pct of exports and in had a total value of around billion dlrs but he added they are always pretty aggressive and theyhave good foreign marketing channels analysts said a key factor in brazilian trade will becoffee and even without background pressure from foreigncreditors the worlds largest producer was

soybean harvestcould total mln tonnes versus mln last year marketings will be very aggressive this summer when pricesare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to thevulnerability of the us crop to bad growing weather another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of areduction in the us government soybean loan rate offered tofarmers who give crops as collateral eshleman said he said there has been some uncertainty this year about thesoybean loan rate which acts as an effective floor for pricesby keeping supplies away from the free market farmers canforfeit their beans to the

below mln bushels a week from around mln bushels currently jose melicias from the research department of drexelburnham lambert said brazil would be trying to export as muchas it can this year because of its economic situation he said the debt situation was a major consideration thebrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay forstorage he added asked if a return to an inflationary

generate capital brazil is faced with a poor sugar harvest whichcould limit exports to the world market analysts said thecountry may have oversold and be unable to honor exportcommitments and this plus higher domestic demand caused byconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar willgive it little room to stretch exports they said brazils other major crop cocoa is in its third year
